# Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
# are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
# locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:

ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
  inflect.singular "axis", "axis" # Not sure about this (plural: axes)
  inflect.irregular "part of speech", "parts of speech"
end

# These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
# ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
#   inflect.acronym 'RESTful'
# end
